# ===== Lab04 Companion Computer Configuration =====
# This single .env file is used by all projects (1-7)
# Not all variables are used in every project - see comments

# ===== CORE MQTT SETTINGS (Projects 2-7) =====
# These are essential for any project using MQTT

# non-secure
# MQTT_BROKER=your-mqtt-broker.example.com
# MQTT_PORT=1883                    # Use 8883 for TLS
# MQTT_USE_TLS=false               # Set to true for secure connection
# MQTT_CA_CERT_PATH=ca.crt         # Only needed when MQTT_USE_TLS=true


# secure
MQTT_BROKER=your-mqtt-broker.example.com
MQTT_PORT=8883                    # Use TLS port
MQTT_USE_TLS=true                 # Enable secure connection
MQTT_CA_CERT_PATH=ca.crt          # Relative path is OK if you run from this folder


# ===== BASIC MQTT CREDENTIALS (Projects 2-3) =====
# Projects 2-3 use these simple credentials
# Note: Projects 4-7 use role-specific credentials below instead

MQTT_USERNAME=your_username              # Default username for initial tests
MQTT_PASSWORD=your_password              # Default password for initial tests

# ===== MQTT TOPICS (Projects 4-7) =====
# Topics for multi-vessel coordination

SCOUT_POSITION_TOPIC=scout/position
TEAM1_POSITION_TOPIC=team1/position
TEAM2_POSITION_TOPIC=team2/position
TEAM3_POSITION_TOPIC=team3/position

# ===== ROLE-BASED MQTT CREDENTIALS (Projects 4-7) =====
# Each role has separate credentials for multi-vessel scenarios

# Scout configuration

# Team 3 configuration
TEAM3_MQTT_USERNAME=team3_user
TEAM3_MQTT_PASSWORD=team3_pass
TEAM3_COMMANDS=team3/commands

# ===== SITL CONNECTION STRINGS (Projects 4-7) =====
# UDP connections for SITL simulation
# Projects 1-3 use hardcoded connection strings

# ===== OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS (Projects 7+) =====
# Behavioral parameters for autonomous operations

SAFE_FOLLOW_DISTANCE=10          # Minimum distance in meters
